# Logic Library (TTL Digital Logic Simulator)

This is a logic emulator.  The purpose of this project is to simulate digital logic circuits from a stand-point of timing.  
Each logic gate can be setup to represent different types of TTL logic timings.  Then a circuit can be wired up and executed 
to see what the timinig output would be.

This project is a work in progress...
